# Playground

This is a playground, you can test latests branches without have to be in an libp2p package.

This package is not gonna be affected by `./workspace.sh {local,refresh}` and
is not gonna be redirected from other package (other package of the repo are
still redirected here to your workspace but not inversely.).
